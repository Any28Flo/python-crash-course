You can use the _replace()_ method to replace any word in a string with a different 
word. Here's a quick example showing how to replace 'dog' with cat in a sentence 
```python
message = 'I really like dogs.'
message.replace('dog','cat')
'I really like cat'
```
Read in each line from the file you just created, _learning_python.txt_ and replace the word
python with the name of another language, such as C. Print each modified line to the screen.
