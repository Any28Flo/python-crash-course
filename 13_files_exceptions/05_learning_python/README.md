- [ ] Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines summarizing what you've learned about Python so far. Start each line with the phrase 
_In python you can ..._. 
- [ ] Save the file as learning_python.txt in the same 
directory as your exercises from this chapter. 
- [ ] Write a program that reads the file
  - prints what you wrote two times: print the contents once by reading
in the entire file, 
  - and once by storing the lines in a list and then looping over each line.
