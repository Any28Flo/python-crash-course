One common problem when propting for numerical input occurs
when people provide text instead of numbers. When you tyr
to convert the input to an int, you'll get a _*ValueError*_.

Write a program that prompts for two numbers.
Add them together and print the result. 
Catch the _*ValueError*_ if either input value es not 
a number, and print a fliendly error message.
Test your program by entering two numbers and then 
by entering some text instead of a number.
