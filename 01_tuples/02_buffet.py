"""
A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods. Think of five
simple foods, and store them in a tuple.
- Use a for loop to print each food the restaurant offers.
- Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python reject the change.
- The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with different food.
- Add a line that rewrites the tuple, and then use a for loop to print each of the items on the revised menu
