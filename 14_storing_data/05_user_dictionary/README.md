<hr/>

The _remember_py_ example only stores one piece of information, the username.
Expand this example by asking for two more pieces of information about the user, then 
store all the information you collect in a dictionary. Write this dictionary 
to a file using json.dumps(), and read it back in using json.loads(). 
Print a summary showing exactly what your program remembers about the user.
